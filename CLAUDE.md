# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a communication experiment project that uses tmux with two panes, each running Claude Code instances with different roles:
- One instance acts as an instructor/director
- The other instance acts as a worker/executor

The goal is to test collaborative AI communication patterns where one Claude Code instance gives instructions and the other carries out the work.

## Repository Structure

This is a minimal repository currently containing only documentation. The project is in Japanese and focuses on AI-to-AI communication workflows using Claude Code.

## Development Notes

- The repository uses Japanese for documentation and communication
- This is an experimental project exploring multi-instance Claude Code collaboration
- No build tools, dependencies, or code execution commands are currently present
